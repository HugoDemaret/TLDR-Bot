TL;DR is a powerful Discord bot that leverages natural language processing to enhance your server experience. With TL;DR, you can easily summarise conversations, detect users' moods, create a social graph of your server, and automate moderation tasks. Whether you're looking to streamline discussions or maintain a healthy server environment, TL;DR has got you covered.

## Features

- Conversation Summarisation: TL;DR uses advanced natural language processing techniques to generate concise summaries of conversations, allowing you to quickly grasp the main points without reading through lengthy threads.

- Mood Detection: By analysing text content, TL;DR can detect the mood of users and display it in a clear way, crossing the barrier between IRL and textual conversations. This feature is most helpful for people who struggle to detect emotion in textual content.

- Social Graph Generation: TL;DR generates a social graph based on user interactions, providing insights into the network of relationships within your server. Visualise connections and identify key influencers to better understand your community.

- Automatic Moderation: Utilising sophisticated algorithms, TL;DR helps you maintain a safe and welcoming environment by automatically moderating your server. Set up custom rules and let the bot handle repetitive tasks, ensuring peace of mind for administrators.
