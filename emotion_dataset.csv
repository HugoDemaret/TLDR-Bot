This is great,joy
Yay,joy
I am curious,surprise
Ye can do,neutral
nice,joy
Nice,joy
I am however not sure about using french : ),fear
"ye if we translate it will be quite useless, and could even decrease precision",fear
"I guess when you fine tune you just adjust the topmost classification layers, so you don't really get to add a lot to the core of the language mpdel",neutral
(was going to follow-up but got interrupted : / ) : so you don't really improve the core lm's capabilities of handling another language,sadness
Hmmm ye I see,neutral
niiiiice,joy
I am glad you work son,joy
You will create the best dataset the world has ever seen,joy
I have faith in you,joy
"Anyway I have to keep talking so we have more data, easy way to get more time spent on the project :p",joy
I need to go take a shower soon it's getting late,sadness
I didn't see the time pass by as I was busy coding,surprise
You get a feeling of accomplishment,joy
But it's nice to get work done,joy
<:coderW:814619973916950539>,neutral
:o lots of messages yay people are using the feature it feels nice,joy
I feel kinda sleepy,sadness
Do you want me to tell you a story son ?,joy
I will make one up as I can't find one on the spot,neutral
Once upon a time there was a princess,neutral
The princess was really beautiful,joy
She loved to use snails in her skincare routine,disgust
She said it was really great for her skin,joy
Her subjects really admired her,joy
So they soon began to put snails on their skin as well,disgust
So many snails were used that their population began to dwindle,sadness
The local wizard became angry that he couldn't find any snails for his potions,anger
So he came to see the princess,neutral
I love this story,joy
He offered her a sponsorship with the new brand SnailFreeCosmetics ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,neutral
je propose d'utiliser la distance discr√®te,neutral
je propose d'utiliser la distance discr√®te,joy
There was a lot of money involved to the princess of course accepted,joy
The princess began advertising SnailFreeCosmetics ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è products on all her socials,neutral
Everyone therefore stopped using snails because it was *sooo* out of trend,neutral
And the snails took that opportunity to reproduce,neutral
"In fact, the snails became sentient due to genetic drift",neutral
"Indeed, the remaining snails were the most intelligent ones as they knew how to effectively hide from humans",neutral
The sentient snails were enraged by their genocide from the human population,anger
So they decided to switch the tide and genocide the human population instead,anger
They reproduced so fast that they were almost as many as it would take to invade the whole kingdom,neutral
Though the humans had no idea for the snails were smart and hid underground,surprise
: ))),joy
yee,joy
Does it render well now?,neutral
Hmm not really,surprise
What about now ?,neutral
Even worse :/,anger
I don't have much hope but let's try,anger
Ye nope XD,joy
Ok now it should work,neutral
Yay it works,joy
the weather is so nice today,joy
but losing one hour of sleep is very annoying,sadness
why do they keep inflicting us this again and again?,anger
I cannot even sync with the nature rhythms or whatever (the stuff they advise for jet lag),sadness
"it takes likes weeks for people to really adapt to this, and in the meanwhile you get more or less subtly tired and cranky people all around you",anger
"and the mornings oh, the morning are the worst, I just dread the 6am (supposedly 7 am ) rolling out of bed",fear
XD,joy
Hello son did you miss me?,neutral
I think it's time for another story,joy
One upon a time there was a dragon,neutral
The dragon was born in a quite renowned family of fearless and poweful dragons,neutral
"But our dragon was smol, really smol and weak",sadness
Every member of its family constantly laughed at it for being so weak,sadness
The poor dragon thus decided to run away and began to aimlessly wander the wasteland its ancestors created all around their territory,sadness
Finding food was hard as next to no living beings could survive in such harsh an environment,sadness
"But our dragon, whilst starving, came upon a cute caterpillar",surprise
Every other dragon would have eaten it without a thought but our protagonist was way too empathetic to take a life,surprise
So it decided to spare the poor little caterpillar which resonated with it,joy
"The caterpillar, who thought its life would be over, was really grateful the dragon spared it, and decided to travel along with the dragon",joy
The pair managed to find some seeds in a dead adventurer's pocket,disgust
They decided to cultivate these seeds to create a reliable food source,neutral
"Upon the seeds' growth, a few other animals were attracted by the appealing plants growing in such scorched land",joy
"Though they weren't aggressive, and joined the others in what appeared to be a developing society based on kindness and empathy",joy
"After a few years, they expanded their lands in what travellers described as an oasis blooming with life in the most desolated place, it truly seemed like a safe haven for all animals",joy
"The dragon family, who ruled with power and fear, did not appreciate such society invading their territory",anger
They thus decided to burn it all to the ground until there were none but ashes,anger
Our smol dragon decided to fight back and not let its friends die,anger
So it called for help to everyone in reach,neutral
"Rumbling in the distance was getting louder and louder, as the menacing dragons were approaching",fear
But our tiny society grew every day with hundreds of animals from all species joining to protect hope,joy
"The fight was inevitable, and noone knew what the outcome would be",fear
"When the dragons arrived, they breathed heavy fire over the whole oasis",anger
"But through evapotranspiration clouds had formed over the plant-rich place and hevy rain fell, nullifying the fire",surprise
The dragons therefore decided to physically attack the small structures the animals lived in,anger
"The big species were too arrogant to help the weak ones, so noone could oppose a threat to the fearsome dragons",fear
"Though our smol boi dragon decided to fight back with all its might, as puny as this attempt to save its friends may be",surprise
But it was so weak it couldn't possibly stand a chance,sadness
"Though it had gathered many friends along the way, and they weren't going out without giving all they got",neutral
"They all decide to unite, and through *the power of friendship*, the smol dragon's power grew tremendously",joy
"Its power was truly magnificent, it became the most powerful dragon to ever live",fear
"It therefore easily managed to earn it's peers' trust, and became the leader of its clan",neutral
"With its new influence, it ruled mandatory empathy classes for strong and big species provided by teacher caterpillar",neutral
"And the plantfull society grew throughout all of the dragons' lands, prospering as everyone aspired to join such nice a place",neutral
"No dragon was angry and aggressive anymore, and peace reigned in the whole world",joy
*The end*,neutral
"Ye better with the cross at the beginning, you don't have to wait to discard a message",neutral
"If we could gravitate towards disgust/fear it would be great, they're the least present right now :D",joy
Hmmm,surprise
I put the wrong file XD,joy
Nice,joy
:))),neutral
Hmmm,neutral
Oh well let's say it's good so hard to center it,anger
Hmm let's use this,neutral
Now to say disgusting things,disgust
Ew,disgust
There's a dead body on the floor,disgust
There are worms crawling through it,disgust
That's disgusting,disgust
There are flies all over it as well,disgust
The killer is behind me!!!!!!,fear
They want to kill me x-x,fear
What can I do,fear
I better run away,fear
Else I'll get caught,fear
And probably tortured,fear
Please someone help me,fear
:ooo i didn't know that,surprise
wow,surprise
wtf,anger
I didn't expect that,surprise
damn,surprise
Really???,surprise
I am flabbergasted,surprise
grrr,anger
:(,anger
My dog died,sadness
I'm so sad,sadness
ToT,sadness
I don't know how to live without my dog,sadness
I miss him,sadness
Sadge,sadness
Urgh,anger
bruh,anger
there's ants crawling on the floor,disgust
they're going towards a dead deer,disgust
It was shot between its eyes,disgust
I can see its brain sticking out,disgust
It's almost like seing a zombie,disgust
Or a ghoul,disgust
Never knew how to tell them apart,neutral
But still it's disgusting,disgust
Makes me want to throw up,disgust
this fucking pest,anger
Yee go all out we need more anger XD,joy
and sadness i guess,neutral
Ye everything that's not joy nor neutral,neutral
my parents died,sadness
Were they decapitated?,disgust
huh idk,neutral
I love seing heads chopped off,disgust
my parents died !,sadness
Especially when there's still blood pouring out,disgust
Gl gl,neutral
yeah i have not done a lot of work and i'm still procrastinating,neutral
I am procrastinating doing stuff by doing other stuff like the moodtraining count command :p,sadness
in comparaison,neutral
yeah but i'm not doing a lot,sadness
"Eeh I'm not productive most of the time it comes in waves for me, I'm in a good mood right now",joy
i have to ask does the user's answers affect the bot reflecion on the message's mood ?,neutral
"Not for now, I put each message with its emotion (assignes by the user) in a dataset that i'll use later to finetune a model",neutral
nice,neutral
But it doesn't affect this model,neutral
what is a coroutine,neutral
So we need about the same number of messages per emotion as not to have a bias,neutral
bias can be present even with the same number of messages per emotions,neutral
"It's a bit of code executed asynchronously, so you don't know when it will be executed",neutral
Like the bot putting the reactions :p,neutral
yeah still have some difficulties on the thread,neutral
"For the thread when you go process a message (commands excluded) you put the processing function as async then in on_messageAutoMod you call it with `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(method, bot.autoModLoop)`",neutral
This way it will be executed in your loop (~thread),neutral
it needs to be async or is there another type of function processing used ?,neutral
The function you call in `run_coroutine_threadsafe` must be async,neutral
ah threadsafe forces async ?,surprise
"But inside it not everything needs to be async, in fact nothing needs to",neutral
"Ye it throws a coroutine in the loop, so it needs to be a coroutine = async",neutral
"So when you need to call a method from discord's API, you also do `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` but with bot.loop",neutral
yeah with autoModloop,neutral
Only bot.loop can interact with the API,neutral
then messageProccess calls commands that call your section,neutral
Ye in your on_message you call the commands from your section (defined in your section of commands.py) then treat the message in your loop,neutral
hello @Ioana,neutral
shall we go into a 3 axis discussion ?,neutral
I have to restart the bot before I tried not to add every reaction unless the bot is wrong,neutral
paw patrol is really old,neutral
Yeee,joy
First try,neutral
oh wow,surprise
Hmmm I put the ones that were already there but I could think of putting some others,neutral
It can quickly become a mess though,fear
Screaming kids,fear
I can't really map my perceived moods to the current categories,neutral
Sorry I had to fix a bug,neutral
?,surprise
Why is the arrow in front now :/,anger
well i wanted to change the bot answers after clicking the arrow but when the emotions (emoji) pilled up it automatically closed,surprise
I might need to do some .result() to get them sequentially,neutral
Ye ye that is fixed I forgot to put return so it deleted the message,neutral
"It will stay until a reaction is inputted, and someone else can input it",neutral
The philosophy of that is interesting :))) maybe people disagree on a specific message's mood,neutral
i mean this is limited by the context,neutral
"Hmmm true, but it's less painful to trust people than check if the one reacting is the author, especially if someone can't be bothered to input the reactions and it leaves a lot of messages polluting the channel",neutral
Yeah also you know when you feel sad but your message is not sad in itself but you mark it as sad :))),neutral
"i mean even with infinite data, if you can't process the context we can't make it 100% perfect",neutral
Sure but I don't aim to create a perfect model the goal is to make one more precise than the current one,neutral
i hate humans,joy
"And to learn how to finetune a model, that's a personal goal",neutral
The humain version is faulty as well :)))),sadness
also the bot takes his answers but not our answers for our current mood ?,surprise
A *noble* goal : p,joy
"No its answers only serve for the checkmark, a sort of quick access :p",neutral
<:coderW:814619973916950539>,joy
What the user inputs is what's written in the dataset,neutral
Ye to finetune our own model which hopefully will be better adapted to discord,neutral
At least to the people on this server :))),joy
i mean we **have** to at least deliver this bot to a bigger server,neutral
for a better finutune,neutral
"Ye true, we'll say that the dataset will keep expanding as the bot joins more servers so it will be more precise and more general with time",neutral
But we can't really create a perfect unbiased general dataset in two weeks :p,joy
XDDD normal conversations aren't great for attaining equal repartition,joy
Ye but too many emotions will probably make it a mess,fear
I'm open to adding more emotions it just has to be a reasonable number do the color-coding still works and they have to be pertinent,neutral
Yeah also is the model fine tunable with a set of different classif labels?,neutral
"That's a part I'm a bit scared about but it should be, I'd be more inclined to use distilbert/distillroberta as thay're the most used for emotion computing and a lot of models have different emotions",fear
I just have to look into how exactly can one precise what the outputs are,neutral
"Maybe @Luc you c1n imagine some hierarchical mood structure, where only top level emotions have colors?",neutral
"Hmmm I could, another point I'm worried about is that the more emotions we add the more data we need for it to be decently precise",fear
"Like hope, contempt, love all go with joy?:))",neutral
"laughter, playfulness :p",joy
"It will make it messy to input the emotions via reactions as well though, more than 2 clicks and a lot of people won't bother participating",fear
"It's a bit sad but I think I might prefer keeping these ones for now to make sure it's stable, and putting the extension of the processed emotions as a possible improvement in the presentation",sadness
You are quite right on that,neutral
I also prefer helping others to make sure everything works than improving something not really needed and not having time to finish everything,neutral
That is very wise and reasonable ; ),neutral
Btw I think it's not a very entagled sample but this discussion is pretty usable for the agreement / disagreement estimator ; ),neutral
"Ye it's a great casual conversation, and unbiased because we didn't have a specific purpose in mind",joy
wait no beginning of L3 ?,surprise
If you're talking about argumentation we'll do some tomorrow in AI,neutral
Btw I think it's not a very entangled sample but this discussion is pretty usable for the agreement / disagreement estimator ; ),neutral
"332 entries already, if we manage to keep the same rythm we might get around 3k to work with",neutral
Though the emotion proportions aren't really equal,sadness
Thing is when we start talking about techical details we're ungortunately into neutrel territory :((,sadness
Yea that's true,sadness
But fortunately that is perfect for agreement / disagreement computation :)),joy
and the garbage collector are still on strike,anger
love it to exit my home with 20 trashbins,anger
And it gets me an hour of spent time :p,joy
Thing is when we start talking about techical details we're unfortunately into neutrel territory :((,sadness
Also great !!!:))),joy
They are (thank all gods united) not on strike here,joy
But last time I went to my sister's place I almost couldn't make it to the building's entrance bc of the trash wall,disgust
Ye no worries but for the next ones :D,joy
I can change stuff if wrong input the the *forge* !,joy
Ye it's part of the mood branch but I didn't assign it to anyone as we'll all do it,neutral
:o,surprise
33.3,neutral
"But I won't change it now because I am on my phone, chasing kiddies :((",sadness
AAAAAH I didn't close the plot that's why XDDD,surprise
I don't want to be remembered as a neutral person : p,sadness
XDDD,joy
Ok bot rebooted,neutral
Ah we need to have a mood for the command to work,surprise
Ye fixed,joy
@Luc neutral and no mood are 2 different states?:)),surprise
Ye you can have no mood but not be neutral :p,joy
"No mood = we don't know because no material to compute from, neutral = we could compute and it was neutral",neutral
Is it worth merging the two?,neutral
Then the plots would be 99% neutral most users are inactive at a given point on a server,neutral
Like the social graph will 1ccount for the *quantity of interactions *,neutral
"Ye but the social graph is based on the whole history of the server, the mood is only from recent messages as there are timed resets",neutral
*also right* : ))),neutral
üëÄ,surprise
"2 out of 3 kids back to their parents' house, relief is a strong and distinctive mood :))",joy
connection,neutral
Now it should work,neutral
If it's more eye-catching there should be less accidental answers,neutral
ok,neutral
No data sadge,sadness
"This whole construction so fragile, so brittle, depending on so many variables",fear
Maybe when everything is checked properly on my side all has long since crumbled,fear
This is already under siege,fear
Maybe outside forces will just change all outcome before I even make sense of everything,fear
Maybe all my conjectures are wrong and stuff will just disintegrate,fear
Maybe I will not be able to hold my part,fear

"Wait, were we supposed to play fair?",surprise
"I can't believe they won, that's unfair to everyone that lost",anger
That ruined my day,anger
But strangely the winner never claimed his prize!,surprise
Why though,surprise
Even though they won just like that they don't claim it?,surprise
Now that's disrespectful,anger
How could they do that to us,disgust
We're bound never to win anything,sadness
We're so useless,sadness
